I'm Ellen and I live in New Zealand. I've always wanted to learn and become a proficient computer programmer but I've never had the confidence to take the plunge. 2018 is the year where I am thinking seriously about my career and researching options for the skills I want to learn. This years gone by so quickly, it already being October. But I have the determination to finish strong and give myself a headstart into 2019 where I'll strive everyday to reach my goals.
